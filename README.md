# user-registration-and-login-PHP

l Design a fully functional flow of a typical user registration and login page.

l It should have a responsive UI.

l The registration page should record user data such as, Name, Email ID, Password, Address, Phone number.

l The login page should validate the user based on Email and Password used while registering.

l Use the PHP-MySQLi (Object-oriented or procedural style is upto you) library for interfacing with the Database backend.

l Use MySQL database server to persist the data.
